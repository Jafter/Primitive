Java SDK Version 1.8, Applet

This program's Main class is Primitive.java, and was initially created through figuring out Notch's Left4kDead
game and how it all came together. Using its intro screen, and pixel map, I began fiddling around with a
primitive form of AI. Hence the name: Primitive.

This program is far for finished, and is more of a hobby of mine. Feel free to use this code to your own purposes, I
hope you have as much fun as I did fiddling around with it. All I ask that that Notch and I are sourced in the
documentation, I go by Jafter.
