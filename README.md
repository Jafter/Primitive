# Primitive
A primitive AI applet that collects resources and deposits it into its parent node. Intro screen and map inspired by Notch's Left4kDead.

Java SDK Version 1.8, Applet

This program's Main class is Primitive.java, and was initially created through figuring out Notch's Left4kDead
game and how it all came together. Using its intro screen, and pixel map, I began fiddling around with a
primitive form of AI. Hence the name: Primitive.

This program is far from finished, and is more of a hobby. Feel free to use this code to your own purposes, I
hope you have as much fun as I did fiddling around with it.

When the program is run, a white-noise background with appear with the word "Primitive". To start the simulation, simply click in the window. You may also click the window again during the simulation to generate a new one. Each iteration is random.
